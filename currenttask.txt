(SOLVED) ---Write a method to get the panel length in the door object
        use this to correctly position door objects
        RESOLVED: JUST PASS AS AN ARGUMENT

(SOLVED) fix the door being spawned in the wrong places 
        problem located - gamepanel dimensions are zero 
        SOLUTION: component location set in paintComponent method (GamePanel)

(SOLVED) add doors for every room:
                doors should be stored in an array list 
                        to determine collisions, run has collided on every object in gameloop
                the number of available doors should be determined from the active room object
                doors should all be initialized with given room and direction
                        after update method (wip), rerender doors in gameloop as appropriate
                door positions for all 4 doors should be properly set in paintComponent method
                doors should rerender every room Change

(DONE)       room class 
                has an arraylist feild to contain all possible door directions for given room, along with keys 
                        done manually through constructor
                also contains the nessicary filepath for image
                contains a key corresponding to it's doors (INCORRECT, LOGIC TO FIX BELOW)
                contains a get/set key method (through constructor)

(FIXED)     INTIT KEYS CORRECTLY 
                These keys are housed in the 2d array map, which has each room mapped to a 
            specific key    

(SOLVED)        set player to door side when changing rooms 
                just set location after room changes    

(SOLVED)IMPLEMENT ACTIVATE BATTLEMODE METHOD 

        should modify movement to be restricted to "Button" objects (IMPLEMENT)
                -button objects should have two images, one when selected and one when not (IMPLEMENT)
                -if confused, they are literally just the fight-act-item-mercy buttons
                -make one class, and have each be given two image arguments and a name (IMPLEMENT)
                        (EXAMPLE: "act", "imageEx.png", "imageEx1.png")
        any keyboard inputs that arent left-right-z should be disregarded in keylistener (IMPLEMENT)

IMPLEMENT GENERIC ENEMY CLASS

        all non boss enemies will be subclasses of this class
        all will be held in an arraylist feild (IMPLEMENT)
